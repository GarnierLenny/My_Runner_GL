# My_Runner_GL
Runner game made with love and CSFML

This is My_Runner_GL repository.
It consists of a runner game.
To make it work you'll need CSFML package installed.
Once you have CSFML installed and cloned this repository you must type "make" on the terminal and execute the generated binary "my_runner" by typing: "./my_runner"
Once the game is launched you'll see your character running on the left side of the screen, birds will be coming at you, to dodge them jump by pressing space at the right moment.
This project isn't finished so I plan to work on it, I'll keep you updated.

Thanks for playing and do not hesitate to give feedback or/and rate my project !
